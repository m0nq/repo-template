# Website Checklist & Read Me Template

This is a standard website checklist for building any new websites, whether it's green or brown field project.

## Website Checklist

- [ ]  Use clean code: Write clean, well-organized code that is easy to read and maintain. Use comments and meaningful variable names to make your code more understandable to others.
- [ ]  Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your code and collaborate with others. This will make it easier to track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
- [ ]  Create case studies: Showcase your projects by creating detailed case studies that describe the problem you were solving, your approach, and the results. This will demonstrate your problem-solving skills and give potential employers or clients a better understanding of your work.
- [ ]  Add tracking: Implement Google Analytics or a similar tool to track visits, clicks, and user behavior on your portfolio website. This will help you understand your audience and make informed decisions about your content and design.
- [ ]  Add a form: Include a contact form on your portfolio website so potential employers or clients can easily get in touch with you. Make sure to validate user input and handle form submissions securely.
- [ ]  Use at least one API: Integrate at least one external API into your portfolio website to demonstrate your ability to work with third-party services. For example, you could use the GitHub API to display your latest repositories or the Twitter API to show your latest tweets.
- [ ]  Add a blog: Consider adding a blog section to your portfolio website where you can share your thoughts on industry trends, your latest projects, or tutorials. This will demonstrate your expertise and help you establish yourself as a thought leader in your field.
- [ ]  Use responsive design: Make sure your portfolio website looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Use media queries and other techniques to ensure your website is responsive and performs well on different screen sizes.
- [ ]  Optimize for speed: Make sure your portfolio website loads quickly by optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and using a content delivery network (CDN) if necessary. This will ensure a smooth user experience and help your website perform better in search rankings.
- [ ]  Use testing: Write automated tests to ensure your code works as expected and catches bugs early on. Use tools like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Write unit tests and integration tests for your back-end code to ensure it works as expected and catches bugs early on.
- [ ]  Use accessibility best practices: Make sure your portfolio website is accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and other accessibility best practices to ensure your website is inclusive and user-friendly.
- [ ]  Use SEO best practices: Optimize your portfolio website for search engines by using relevant keywords, meta tags, and other SEO best practices. This will help your website rank higher in search results and attract more traffic.
- [ ]  Use web performance best practices: Use techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and caching to improve your website's performance and reduce load times. This will ensure a better user experience and help your website perform better in search rankings.
- [ ]  Use security best practices: Implement security best practices like using HTTPS, validating user input, and using secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. This will help protect your website and your users from security threats. Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Make sure to sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- [ ]  Use design best practices: Use design best practices like whitespace, typography, and color theory to create a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website. Use tools like Sketch or Figma to create mockups and prototypes.
- [ ]  Use a database: Use a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store data and retrieve it efficiently. Make sure to optimize your database queries for performance.
- [ ]  Build RESTful APIs: Build RESTful APIs to handle client-server communication and make it easier to integrate your portfolio with other applications.
- [ ]  Use caching: Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to speed up your application and reduce database load.
- [ ]  Use error handling: Implement error handling and logging to make it easier to debug your application and identify issues
- [ ]  Use TypeScript: Use TypeScript to add static typing to your JavaScript code and catch errors before runtime. This will improve the maintainability and scalability of your codebase.
- [ ]  Add Dark mode: Adding Dark Mode is a common feature that shows you can use javascript and color theory to give the user control of the UI based on their preferences.
- [ ]  Implement Design Psychology Practices: Focus on using color and White Space to make your website work for you.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
